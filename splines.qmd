-   Splines give the opportunity to model non-linear interactions

-   So far have tested with 2 knots on Impact and Dransfield 2 (biggest studies with eos)

-   used aov with a linear interaction and a spline term to see if there was a benefit to using splines over linear interaction

-   Riley ch7 p191 @riley2021

-   Suggests using mv meta

## Questions to ask

-   how many knots?

-   potential issues with stability, especially for low event rates (e.g., pneumonia)

-   interpretation of interaction coefs

Had a play with the studies that use EOS

interpretation of mvmeta (set with splines at 0.1, 0.25 and then capped at 0.6).

It does seem that the spline is associative. I made two models, one with arm\*spline(eos) and the other with arm+spline(eos)+spline(arm\*eos) and got basically the same results.
