Could be computationally intensive though (as then you be making 10k predictions.\nIn practice you could end up having to impute on the client-side which may not be possible\nOr you use mean/mode imputation for new predictions.\n\n\n\n\nTang, Fei, and Hemant Ishwaran. 2017. “Random Forest Missing Data Algorithms.” Statistical Analysis and Data Mining 10 (6): 363–77. https://doi.org/10.1002/sam.11348.",
