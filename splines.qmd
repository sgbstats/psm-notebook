-   Splines give the opportunity to model non-linear interactions

-   So far have tested with 2 knots on Impact and Dransfield 2 (biggest studies with eos)

-   used aov with a linear interaction and a spline term to see if there was a benefit to using splines over linear interaction

-   Riley ch7 p191 @riley2021

-   Suggests using mv meta

## Questions to ask

- how many knots?

- potential issues with stability, especially for low event rates (e.g., pneumonia)

- interpretation of interaction coefs
