# Pattern Submodels

This is my notebook for all things pattern submodels.

PSM is an under developed method of creating an ensemble of models, one for each of the missing data patterns @fletcher_mercaldo_missing_2020.

## Background

In most clinical prediction models, missing data is either ignored or mean imputed @nijman_missing_2022 @tsvetanova_missing_2021

Using complete-case analysis is only valid when the data is MCAR @rubin1976 @little2019. This leads to the problem of trying to create a CPM when the data is most likely MAR.

## Rationale

The aim is for their to be a prediction model that can be used in general practice and not all parameters are available at all times, especially blood tests. In Bate's review @bate2024, it is noted that several covid prediction models use parameters that are not always available and this means that more often than not, the model can't be used (the review that was in the context of ICU and set in a University Hospital).

## Studies

In ICS-Recode, clinical data is taken from across studies, with various degrees of missingness. Given that all of the data that is included in the development data are from clinical trials, there data is on the whole very complete. See [studies list](studies.qmd)

## How do pattern submodels work?

Within a models there are 2\^p missingness patterns, every combination of missing and not. Obviously not all patterns are present within the data. For each pattern of data, a model is fitted using only the data that has that pattern (apart from when there are insufficient data when a complete case models).

Currently it is believed that the psm can handle MAR data because the pattern can take in information from the missingness.

The benefit of these models is that in the wild, there may be reasonable and sensible amounts of missing data and it is useful for the model to be able to handle these users with incomplete data without having to revert to mean/mode imputation.

## What are the current concerns?

-   Regularisation/shrinkage is a major concern

### To do list

-   Document all of the code so far

-   Discuss issues with model selection and shrinkage

### One day

-   I will make this into a proper R package
