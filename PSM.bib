	abstract = {Missing data are a common problem for both the construction and implementation of a prediction algorithm. Pattern submodels (PS)—a set of submodels for every missing data pattern that are ﬁt using only data from that pattern—are a computationally efﬁcient remedy for handling missing data at both stages. Here, we show that PS (i) retain their predictive accuracy even when the missing data mechanism is not missing at random (MAR) and (ii) yield an algorithm that is the most predictive among all standard missing data strategies. Speciﬁcally, we show that the expected loss of a forecasting algorithm is minimized when each pattern-speciﬁc loss is minimized. Simulations and a re-analysis of the SUPPORT study conﬁrms that PS generally outperforms zero-imputation, mean-imputation, complete-case analysis, complete-case submodels, and even multiple imputation (MI). The degree of improvement is highly dependent on the missingness mechanism and the effect size of missing predictors. When the data are MAR, MI can yield comparable forecasting performance but generally requires a larger computational cost. We also show that predictions from the PS approach are equivalent to the limiting predictions for a MI procedure that is dependent on missingness indicators (the MIMI model). The focus of this article is on out-of-sample prediction; implications for model inference are only brieﬂy explored.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Missing data is a common problem during the development, evaluation, and implementation of prediction models. Although machine learning (ML) methods are often said to be capable of circumventing missing data, it is unclear how these methods are used in medical research. We aim to find out if and how well prediction model studies using machine learning report on their handling of missing data.
Study design and setting
We systematically searched the literature on published papers between 2018 and 2019 about primary studies developing and/or validating clinical prediction models using any supervised ML methodology across medical fields. From the retrieved studies information about the amount and nature (e.g. missing completely at random, potential reasons for missingness) of missing data and the way they were handled were extracted.
Results
We identified 152 machine learning-based clinical prediction model studies. A substantial amount of these 152 papers did not report anything on missing data (n = 56/152). A majority (n = 96/152) reported details on the handling of missing data (e.g., methods used), though many of these (n = 46/96) did not report the amount of the missingness in the data. In these 96 papers the authors only sometimes reported possible reasons for missingness (n = 7/96) and information about missing data mechanisms (n = 8/96). The most common approach for handling missing data was deletion (n = 65/96), mostly via complete-case analysis (CCA) (n = 43/96). Very few studies used multiple imputation (n = 8/96) or built-in mechanisms such as surrogate splits (n = 7/96) that directly address missing data during the development, validation, or implementation of the prediction model.
Conclusion
Though missing values are highly common in any type of medical research and certainly in the research based on routine healthcare data, a majority of the prediction model studies using machine learning does not report sufficient information on the presence and handling of missing data. Strategies in which patient data are simply omitted are unfortunately the most often used methods, even though it is generally advised against and well known that it likely causes bias and loss of analytical power in prediction model development and in the predictive accuracy estimates. Prediction model researchers should be much more aware of alternative methodologies to address missing data.},

	abstract = {Objectives
No clear guidance exists on handling missing data at each stage of developing, validating and implementing a clinical prediction model (CPM). We aimed to review the approaches to handling missing data that underly the CPMs currently recommended for use in UK healthcare.
Study Design and Setting
A descriptive cross-sectional meta-epidemiological study aiming to identify CPMs recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which summarized how missing data is handled across their pipelines.
Results
A total of 23 CPMs were included through “sampling strategy.” Six missing data strategies were identified: complete case analysis (CCA), multiple imputation, imputation of mean values, k-nearest neighbours imputation, using an additional category for missingness, considering missing values as risk-factor-absent. 52\% of the development articles and 48\% of the validation articles did not report how missing data were handled. CCA was the most common approach used for development (40\%) and validation (44\%). At implementation, 57\% of the CPMs required complete data entry, whilst 43\% allowed missing values. Three CPMs had consistent paths in their pipelines.
Conclusion
A broad variety of methods for handling missing data underly the CPMs currently recommended for use in UK healthcare. Missing data handling strategies were generally inconsistent. Better quality assurance of CPMs needs greater clarity and consistency in handling of missing data.},

	abstract = {Introduction Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) can improve clinical outcomes in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and eosinophilic airway inflammation, but they also increase the risk of side effects like pneumonia. Blood eosinophils guide ICS use, though evidence is limited. The predictors of treatment REsponse to ICS in COPD: a randomised controlled trials (RCTs) individual participant Data re-Evaluation (ICS-RECODE) research programme will leverage data from large RCTs to identify patients who benefit most from ICS with minimal risk. This protocol details an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis, assessing ICS safety, efficacy and treatment×covariate interactions to identify predictors of treatment response.
Methods and analysis This meta-analysis will adhere to Cochrane, IPD handbook and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidance. We will conduct a two-stage IPD meta-analysis of RCTs evaluating the addition of ICS to maintenance COPD treatments. Only RCTs with at least 500 participants across all eligible arms will be included, to allow for treatment×covariate interaction evaluation. Primary outcomes are severe and moderate or severe exacerbation rates; secondary outcomes assess both safety and efficacy. Data from each RCT will be reanalysed using rigorous, consistent statistical methods. Treatment×covariate interactions will be assessed at the RCT level. Trial treatment effects and the coefficients of treatment×covariate interaction analyses will be pooled using random effects model meta-analysis. Risk of bias will be appraised using RoB-2 informed by IPD, and certainty of evidence will be assessed with GRADE and the Instrument to assess the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses.The ICS-RECODE IPD meta-analysis will make use of the best available data to define evidence-based, precision medicine approaches for ICS use in COPD.
Ethics and dissemination The Health Research Authority approved the ICS-RECODE study, exempting it from ethics review (HRA UK, Reference: 24/HRA/0460). Our findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and shared with the scientific and broader stakeholder communities.

	abstract = {Background: In clinical prediction modelling, missing data can occur at any stage of the model pipeline; development, validation or deployment. Multiple imputation is often recommended yet challenging to apply at deployment; for example, the outcome cannot be in the imputation model, as recommended under multiple imputation. Regression imputation uses a fitted model to impute the predicted value of missing predictors from observed data, and could offer a pragmatic alternative at deployment. Moreover, the use of missing indicators has been proposed to handle informative missingness, but it is currently unknown how well this method performs in the context of clinical prediction models. Methods: We simulated data under various missing data mechanisms to compare the predictive performance of clinical prediction models developed using both imputation methods. We consider deployment scenarios where missing data is permitted or prohibited, imputation models that use or omit the outcome, and clinical prediction models that include or omit missing indicators. We assume that the missingness mechanism remains constant across the model pipeline. We also apply the proposed strategies to critical care data. Results: With complete data available at deployment, our findings were in line with existing recommendations; that the outcome should be used to impute development data when using multiple imputation and omitted under regression imputation. When missingness is allowed at deployment, omitting the outcome from the imputation model at the development was preferred. Missing indicators improved model performance in many cases but can be harmful under outcome-dependent missingness. Conclusion: We provide evidence that commonly taught principles of handling missing data via multiple imputation may not apply to clinical prediction models, particularly when data can be missing at deployment. We observed comparable predictive performance under multiple imputation and regression imputation. The performance of the missing data handling method must be evaluated on a study-by-study basis, and the most appropriate strategy for handling missing data at development should consider whether missing data are allowed at deployment. Some guidance is provided.},
